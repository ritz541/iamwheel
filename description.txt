### **Game Overview**

This is a multiplayer casino-style spinning wheel game where users pay ₹10 to participate. Players are identified by unique random IDs (generated at registration) displayed on the wheel. The game randomly selects one winner after a 5-minute countdown. The winner receives 80% of the total prize pool, while 20% is retained as a platform fee.
